For each time point, we calculated the projection of the current position vector onto a unit vector in the direction of the target. 
The error vector at each time point was then determined by subtracting the projection from the current position.
we created a matrix to store the error values as a function of projection distance, rather than time (to avoid biasing error estimates
towards inactivity along the trajectory). In order to characterize the curvature of the mouse trajectory:
2)we used linear interpolation to upsample the error values (y) along 0.01mm increments along the projection distance (x)
3)we calculated the area under the error_magnitude vs accumulated projection_distance curve
4)we calculated the average error per 0.01mm increment of projection distance as our estimate of average error magnitude
5)we stored the raw maximum error magnitude from the unprocessed data

some things to keep  in mind:
If the participant moves exactly perpendicular or near perpendicular to the target, this estimate will have insufficient observations 
along the domain (accumulated projection distance) to reliably estimate the average error. Thus, it is important to also observe the
angular end-point error for each trial
